* Biggest rule of thumb: elements on the page that got in the way of a normal expected progression of reading the story.
* How people read the page: a little bit across and then a lot down.
* In that kind of normal eye-path, how much stuff is there that is completely irrelevant to the story? All of thoase are going to be distracting, and their going to cause the brain to have to work harder to find out what it is the story is supposed to be.
* [BG note: in print nothing disturbs the flow but maybe a page jump.]

* There's advertising all over this page.
* The headline is left-justified but right below the headline is a series of ads.
* The photo is below the right edge of the headline, and the story is under that but separated by ads. So in order to read the story you need to look diagonally across the page to try to find what the next element of the story is.

Metrics:
* Count the page elements. Try to classify the direction or the path the story takes along the page.
* Straight lines are better than kinked lines. In first example: Kinked line; story below right-most edge of the headline so you literally have to reorient where you're reading. So if you count kinks in the path of the story and unrelated elements that are in the middle of that reading path, I think that that would be a pretty simple metric that would probably be quite powerful.

Study:
* We had was more a set of instincts and rules of thumb. We did not have a kind of a rubric that we were applying as we were trying to find brain-friendly/brain-unfriendly. We had criteria: things we wanted to avoid.
* What I'm giving you now is my best attempt to distill what we were seeing. But its not anything I would describe as a rigorous test of a set of principles. What was rigorously tested was the notion that there is a difference between brain-friendly and brain-unfriendly.

Reading Path:
* Eye-tracking, much of it on print pages. The way the eye naturally goes.

Whitespace:
* Whitespace is not created equal, just like ads is not all created equal. What matters most is where a thing is on the page. Having whitespace around text might no make that much of a difference. In the brain-unfriendly example on the top there's a great deal of whitespace on the right, but it doesn't do a lot of good because your eye isn't naturally drawn there anyway. It's not emphasizing or helping to set off a page element. And if there were an ad in that slot it might not make it more brain-unfriendly.
* Whitespace can set off a point of emphasis to train the eye: This is where the story is on the page geographically. But if you've already done that with other page elements, including the headline and byline, whitespace itself may not be that much of a difference maker.
