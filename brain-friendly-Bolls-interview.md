00:20 NAC (Neeley Ann Current): When you decide what’s brain friendly or not, what descriptors helped you the decision?

0:40 This distinction between brain friendly and brain unfriendly, at its foundational level, first and foremost, is grounded in these fundamental truths about how the brain operates, how it perceives, takes in, evaluates, remembers, and evaluates information.

That's the most important point: at its highest conceptual level, that's the broadest distinction between brain friendly and brain unfriendly. Design and layout of online presentation of information that is brain friendly is going to be structured in a way that will work effectively with those bring truths, rather than against those brain turths, Obviously working with the brain truths would be brain friendly, and working against would be brain unfriendly.

1:33 So these three truths. First and foremost, and probably the most important one in terms of how information appears typically in online news sites is that you have to remember that the brain is a limited capacity processor. What that means is that the brain only has so many resources to allocate all the mental tasks that go on in, just what I described before which is, perceiving, paying attention to, trying to remember, and learn information.

2:02 And it has to simultaneously shift attention and effort between the tasks. And so there's a cost. For every task the brain has to work harder at, there are fewer resources left over to process other tasks.

2:19 And so in terms of online news, I think, probably the most common thing that is done from a design standpoint is there is just too much stuff, or junk on a page in a disjointed fashion. 

2:34 That’s I think that's why Alex is dead on when he talks about reading path. Anyway of structuring the information in terms of the flow of it on a page, that is going to make it easier for the eyes to flow down the page, what that’s doing from a brain perspective is making it easier for the brain to encode that information in short term memory. Meaning they’ll be more tasks left over to do the deeper memory processes involved in actually learning and remembering the information long term.

2:59 That's, from a brain science perspective, or a media and the brain perspective, that's why, I would say, the idea of reading path is probably is structurally very important.

3:12 The other characteristic in terms of categorizing the stories that Alex and I actually used in our lab experiment, was segmenting the paragraphs: shorter, bite size paragraphs, rather than formula blah — here’s the story and here's what's going on in the story paragraphs. Even though I would say, in terms of in of writing for online news, segmenting the paragraph even shorter than his what is typically done on some of the shorter stories that I've seen.

3:48 I think the shorter, more concise, bite size paragraphs in an online environment makes it easier for the brain to process and remember that information. Then if you combine that with an effective reading path then, I think, that amplifies how a design feature a feature of online news writing can work together to make for brain friendly presentation 

4:14 NAC: But don’t news sites sometime want them to be distracted and notice the ads, or is that an old school of thought?

4:35 I think that's leftover thinking from an older school of advertising. The old push model, the model that says as brands you have to shout, you have to grab attention, I think that is an old model that I think is — thank God — quickly dying away.

4:56 Brands are more focused on having conversations with potential customers. And I think that structuring online news presentation that leads to a more effective user experience, from a news perspective, is actually good for advertising as well, because it's going increase the value of any ad presentation that is integrated into that format, that design.

5:26 So I think we've got to get rid of that old school of: we've got to disrupt; we got to interrupt. That is certainly brain unfriendly.

5:35 Because the second brain truth to remember is that the brain is a contextual processor. So anything that that pulls processing away from the central idea of what the what the individual user is focused on is going to be either frustrating, an emotionally negative user experience, or in the case of banner ad blindness ignore it.

5:59 Because the brain is a controlled processor, we've developed the ability to just completely tune out distracting elements. They may get us for a moment, and evoke some negative emotion, and lead to poor user experience — which is just obviously not good for an online news organization wanted to build a relationship with an audience in the first place. Or the user is just going to block it out: banner ad blindness.

6:27 NAC: How do you look at ad placement?

6:37 From a research design perspective we honestly did not do much with ad placement. In launching this research, what Alex and I did is the first step. It’s early research.

7:05  From a brand perspective you’ve got so much going on in the sensory environment, with online news presentation, that any research that’s going to be done on this has to itself take bites. 

7:19 So what Alex and I focused on was the design of the story. I obviously have my own theoretical ideas about how to integrate advertising effectively in that environment, but those ideas don't have any empirical backing just yet. They will sometime soon, but not yet.

7:42 NAC: Let’s take a look at the third component on the brain.

7:50 Sure. The other one — and this might be a little harder to actually quantify, and it’s a factor that’s a little less under the control of news producers and designers — and that is that the brain is a motivated processor. First and foremost, you have to remember that the mission of the brain is, in milliseconds, immediately determine the motivation significance of any information in our sensory environment.

8:20  So from a new perspective what that means is that, in terms of reporting and delivering the news, journalists shouldn’t be afraid of emotion. That motivates the brain to process; that signals importance to the brain.

8:39 You can do that with with with effective news writing, in how you tell a story — using more narrative style writing, with the words that you actually choose. How you write a headline for the story can capture attention, make the story more brain friendly. Because emotion actually make the story easier to process, easier to remember.

9:05 NAC: What were some of the factors in determining one article is brain-friendly, another is not, like the ones in the RJI article? 

9:30 I literally went down the examples of brain friendly and said: How are these paragraph structured? Are they shorter? Are there a lot of distracting elements on the page that are not semantically related to the focus of the news story?

9:50  Also, and this admittedly is not a very scientific way to handle the motivator processing part of this, is just my own gut sense, is there any element in here that’s portraying emotion, such as good photographs? For instance, on the third story you've got a new kind of warm emotionally warm picture of a male and a female embracing each other. That's going to be attention grabbing. That’s evoking mild levels of positive emotion, that can flow and carry over into how the story is read and processed

10:39 In terms of the most important factors that we really weighted in the study, though, it really came down to really focusing in on: The brain is limited capacity processor — looking at the structure of paragraphs, and the presence of distracting elements. And the brain is contextual process. Just in terms of how well the page layout maintained a consistent symantec theme, again, tying into those distracting elements. 

11:15 NAC: So after all this research, what would you tell designers?

11:20 The big takeaway is: Clean it up. Big time, clean it up. 

11:24: You know, the industry talks about this idea of junk on a page, but there’s still a lot of junk on pages out there. So clean it up.

11:35 And what that means in terms of practice is: Segment the paragraphs. It's a lot of focus not on just news design but on effective news writing.

11:47 In fact, really, I think, that effective story delivery begins with effective news writing. So shorten those paragraphs up into snacks, little bits of information, that the brain can then go: Okay, I got this. I can store in memory, now I’m onto the next one, now the next.

12:09 And have that structured, and flow in a way, that's easy for the eyes to structurally go down the page. Have a consistent boxed layout of text on the page. Avoid this practice, that I've seen on some pages, of popping in unrelated links and pictures and content midway through a flow of a body of text. That is probably one of the most brain unfriendly practices in news design.

12:36 I would also say that photojournalism is going to be extremely important in terms of the brain as a motivator processor. While, again here, we didn't do a lot from a scientific perspective on that, photographs are so emotionally powerful. And that's going to motivate people process the storage. It’s going to draw them in. It’s going to evoke more conscious allocation of attention to the story.

13:01 But that image has to be very carefully selected, for it's an appropriate emotional content, and for having it highly semantically related to the actual news writing of the story. And also it’s going to have to be placed a very carefully.

The example for of the brain friendly stories that we have here, again going down to the third one of the image of the male and female embracing, that's a good placement because it's off to the right hand side, so it’s not distracting. But the eyes can go there and go: Oh, that’s nice — it’s evoking some emotion, then automatically jump right down into the text of that story.

13:37 It's capturing attention with a little bit of emotion but not interfering with the experience of reading and trying to remember and learn from the story.

13:50 NAC: What about some other concerns newspapers have: We want our scoial media icons visible — to immediately let everybody know about it and share?

14:13 This is my opinion, informed by brain science: I think the industry needs to rethink how it even attempts to engage readers in social media activity. I think that the industry first needs to clean this up and deliver a great online news reader experience. Then they might actually have a larger community of readers and audience members willing to engage at the level of social media sharing.

14:45 When that time comes, you don't have to worry about disrupting the reading experience, the information processing experience, with icons: “Share this.” “Comment.” And all that. 

15:01 You don't have to worry about disrupting that if you’ve first and foremost delivered a brain effective story, in a well-designed, well-written manner. Because then you might have a reader that might naturally be more motivated to go:  “Hey, this is worth sharing; this is worth commenting on. I'm going to engage in this process of news and how it's supposed to promote democracy.”

15:30 NAC: Isn’t in the interest of the online news sites to posting multiple articles that may be related. You may see that as a distractor, but that’s also in the interest of the journalists: to drive readers to other stories?

15:55 I think the most brain friendly design would be to get those more at the bottom of the story, and not in a place where there is visually disrupting processing the story that a person landed on to read. Let the reader having her experience of reading the story they selected to read. And then, I think honestly, if you delivered a great reader experience with how that story is designed and written, I don't think you have to worry as much about motivating people to go to other content on your news site.

16:36 You’ll have them higher engaged mentally, at a higher emotionally motivated level as a news reader, as an audience member for your news organization. Then when they get to the bottom of that story and they see: “Oh, I might want to read this other story that’s related. At the bottom: don't throw everything in there at once on a page, because really what you doing it just kinda hoping the something gets through, and that’s brain unfriendly.

[17:08 BG: The headline for this: Social engagement starts with... engagement.] 

17:25 The tendency is we have to show all components. We have have the social media visible at all times, to have the links to other articles visible, and the ads.

17:44 Why do they they have to be visible at all times? It’s that “at all times” that I'm picking on. Not everything has to be visible at all times. In fact I would argue, that's part of what has pushed the industry into this brain unfriendly territory, Not everything has to be at all times, if you're delivering a great user experience.

18:00 Let them have their story. When they get down to the sound of the end of the story, then you can introduce these other elements. Social engagement begins with engagement.

18:18 I think that’s a concern with multimedia: We’ve got to have video; we got to have audio. I think socially we’re saying: We’re just a faster paced society. We have more technology. We have a shorter attention span. So, of course, we need to provide more options, and spaces for people to go.

18:47 All that is true about society. But there's a difference between society and the brain. We still have the same brain that our ancient ancestors did, even the society has changed

19:05 It real come down to a fundamental truth for me: Do you want to focus on delivering a great journalistic experience, that achieves the good of Journalism — and, in my mind, can actually also be profitable journalism? Or do you want to just throw your hands up in the air and say: “Society has changed,and we have all this this technology, and so you people are like little gnats. We have to give them this, this, this, and this, and this.” Because they’re going to go all over the place.

19:48 You’ve got to decide. I think one version of that is brain friendly and the other is brain unfriendly and, I think, brain friendly is obviously better.
